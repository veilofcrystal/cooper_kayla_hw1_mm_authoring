this is my example of interactive svg icons.

Using a Cat, Milk carton, ball of yarn, tuna fish, and food bowl SVG, I will create css animations to manipulate the svg images to display different methods of changing svg attributes through code.

The assignment details are as follows:

Interactive SVG Icons

Each Student must build a branded, scalable themed icon set using Adobe Illustrator. Export each icon from Illustrator as an SVG. Use the SVGs as assets on the FIP/Brand Revival site (think icons for different flavours or ingredients). Add some simple interac>vity with JavaScript. Use HTML (and the appropriate elements) to include a descrip>on of the icon set.

Assignment Requirements

Use Terminal, Git and Github to create the project structure and a linked repository. Create a minimum of 6 SVG icons in Illustrator. Use CSS to organize the icons on an HTML page (products)in your FIP. You can choose how you want to implement this - as an image tag source, as an SVG tag, or using the object tag.

Use CSS interac>ons or transi>ons to change the icon’s appearance (on hover, as an example, reverse all of the colours or add a drop shadow, etc). When clicked log a message to the console with the ID of the element that you’ve clicked. The ID should be retrieved and displayed with a JavaScript string template and variable (refer to the class example).

Push the finished files to your repo; include a readme that describes the project. Merge everything to the main branch and submit a link to the dropbox on FOL - a .txt file is fine.

SUBMISSION REQUIREMENTS & DUE DATE

Project must be submiZed Week 5: ONLY THE MAIN BRANCH WILL BE GRADED.NOT ZIPPED FILES! - Github repo: readme.md file, master branch, design branch and development branch
- Correct structure for a web project (css, js, images and index.html)
- DO NOT INCLUDE AI FILES - just the SVGs in the image folder will do.

- Name the dev branches appropriately per feature IE des.tvr.artwork, dev.tvr.script
